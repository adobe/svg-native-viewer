/**
 * Represents a rectangle.
 *
 * The following points hold true for a Rectangle:
 * 1. A rectangle is simply defined by a pair of two Intervals. The set
 * of a rectangle $R$ defined by two Intervals $A$ and $B$ is the set
 * of all points $(x, y)$ such that $x$ is a member of Interval $A$'s
 * set while $y$ is a member of Interval $B$'s set.
 * 2. A rectangle is empty if its set is of length zero.
 * 3. A rectangle $A$ contains a rectangle $B$ if all points of rectangle
 * $B$'s set are also members of the set of rectangle $A$.
 * 4. The intersection of two rectangles $A$ and $B$ is a rectangle whose
 * set contains the elements that are common in the point set of $A$ and
 * that of $B$.
 * 5. The join of two rectangles $A$ and $B$ is a rectangle with the smallest
 * possible point set such that it has all points of $A$ as well as those of
 * set $B$ and is complete, meaning that for any two points in the set, all
 * the points lying between will also be a part of the set. By smallest we mean
 * that no other proper subset of that set should satisfy this requirement.
